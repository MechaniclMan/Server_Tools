MapInstaller V1.0 by genblacky

MapInstaller converts maps then installs them to your ttfs
You can place the contents of the zip into your server folder or place it anywhere you want. 
PackageEditor TT Patch1 is included in zip. 
Place any maps or other packages in the maps folder.
Maps with spaces or periods in their name will not be processed.
A tt.cfg file is generated with the processed maps. 
Yea fuck you ubermappacks XD.
